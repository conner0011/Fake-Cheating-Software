  ## Description 
  This software was designed to be disguised as real cheats for the game "Battle-Bit", but the goal of this project was to create a proof-of-concept design that makes users believe this will provide cheats, but in actuality will run a python script in the background to gather their username, or some other idenifying feature to then send a webhook on discord for the developers of Battle-bit to then manually ban the user.
